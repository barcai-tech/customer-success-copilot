# ðŸš€ Performance & Display Fixes for LLM Planner

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **LLM Planner Timeout on Complex Requests**

**Problem**: Complex requests like "plan QBR with ACME, get all relevant data, draft email" would timeout.

**Root Causes**:

- Too many iterations allowed (`maxSteps = 8`)
- LLM could make multiple rounds of tool calls
- Sequential tool execution taking 2-3 seconds each
- No timeout enforcement
- LLM not forced to finalize after first tool round

**Total time for complex request**:

- 6 tools Ã— 2.7s = ~16 seconds
- LLM thinking time: 2-5s per round Ã— multiple rounds = 10-15 seconds
- **Grand total: 25-30 seconds â†’ TIMEOUT**

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Reduced `maxSteps` from 8 to 5** (line 101)

   ```typescript
   const maxSteps = 5; // Reduced from 8 to prevent timeouts
   ```

2. **Updated system prompt** to be more aggressive about efficiency (line 66-76)

   - Changed "You may call up to 5 tools" â†’ "Call tools efficiently. For complex requests requiring 4+ tools, prioritize the most critical ones first."
   - Added "Stop calling tools once you have enough. Don't over-fetch."
   - Added "IMPORTANT: After calling tools, return your final JSON response immediately. Do not call tools again unless the user explicitly asks for more data."

3. **Force finalization after first tool round** instead of second (line 183)
   ```typescript
   // Changed from: if (toolRounds >= 2)
   if (toolRounds >= 1) {
     messages.push({
       role: "user",
       content:
         "You have the tool outputs. Return the final JSON response now - do NOT call more tools...",
     });
   }
   ```

**Expected Impact**:

- Complex requests complete in **10-15 seconds** instead of 25-30 seconds
- Single round of tool calls (typically 3-5 tools)
- LLM immediately synthesizes response after tools return
- Drastically reduced timeout risk

### 2. **Missing Tools in Technical Details Card**

**Problem**: Some tools weren't showing in the Technical Details UI, even though they were executed.

**Root Cause**: The `usedTools` array merging logic had several issues:

1. **Order-based matching** could skip tools if decisionLog order didn't match execution order
2. **Backfilled health tool** was added to `usedTools` array but after `out.usedTools` was already set
3. **Index-based logic** could miss tools if matching failed

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Improved tool-to-reason matching** (lines 248-272)

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE: Index-based matching with logIdx counter
   // AFTER: Name-based matching with splice to prevent duplicates

   for (let i = 0; i < enriched.length; i++) {
     const toolName = enriched[i].name.toLowerCase();
     const matchIdx = log.findIndex((l) => {
       if (typeof l === "string") {
         return l.toLowerCase().includes(toolName);
       }
       return !l.tool || l.tool.toLowerCase() === toolName;
     });

     if (matchIdx !== -1) {
       enriched[i].reason = typeof entry === "string" ? entry : entry.reason;
       log.splice(matchIdx, 1); // Remove to avoid duplicate matching
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Fixed backfilled health tool** (lines 401-413)

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE: Added to usedTools array (which was already copied to out.usedTools)
   usedTools.push({ name: "calculate_health", tookMs: ... });

   // AFTER: Append directly to out.usedTools
   out.usedTools = [...(out.usedTools || []), backfillTool];
   ```

**Expected Impact**:

- **All executed tools** now appear in Technical Details card
- Proper reason mapping from decisionLog
- No duplicate or missing entries
- Backfilled tools properly tracked

## Files Modified

- **`frontend/src/agent/llmPlanner.ts`**:
  - Line 66-76: Updated system prompt for efficiency
  - Line 101: Reduced maxSteps from 8 to 5
  - Line 183: Force finalization after first tool round
  - Lines 248-272: Improved tool-to-reason matching logic
  - Lines 401-413: Fixed backfilled health tool tracking

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Complex Request Performance

```
Prompt: "I am planning a QBR with ACME for next week, get me all relevant data and draft an email to invite the customer"

Expected:
- Completes in 10-15 seconds (previously 25-30s)
- Calls 4-6 tools in single round
- All tools appear in Technical Details
- Email draft included in response
```

### Test 2: All Tools Visible

```
Prompt: "What's the health status of Globex and should we be concerned about renewal?"

Expected:
- All executed tools appear in Technical Details card
- Each tool shows:
  âœ“ Name (e.g., "get_customer_usage")
  âœ“ Execution time (e.g., "2648ms")
  âœ“ Status (success/error icon)
  âœ“ Reason from decisionLog if available
```

### Test 3: Error Handling

```
Scenario: Tool fails with UNAUTHORIZED

Expected:
- Failed tool still appears in Technical Details
- Shows red error indicator
- Displays error code (e.g., "UNAUTHORIZED")
- Other tools continue executing
```

## Architecture Impact

### Before

```
LLM Request
  â†“
Call 2-3 tools (Round 1) â†’ ~8 seconds
  â†“
LLM thinks â†’ ~3 seconds
  â†“
Call 2-3 more tools (Round 2) â†’ ~8 seconds
  â†“
LLM thinks â†’ ~3 seconds
  â†“
Return JSON
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Total: 22-25 seconds
```

### After

```
LLM Request
  â†“
Call 4-6 tools (Single Round) â†’ ~12 seconds
  â†“
Force immediate JSON response â†’ ~2 seconds
  â†“
Return JSON
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Total: 14-16 seconds âœ…
```

## Additional Optimizations (Future Considerations)

### 1. Parallel Tool Execution

Currently, tools are called sequentially. Consider parallel execution for independent tools:

```typescript
// Instead of sequential:
await tool1();
await tool2();
await tool3();

// Parallel execution:
await Promise.all([tool1(), tool2(), tool3()]);
```

**Benefit**: 3 tools Ã— 2.7s = 8.1s â†’ reduced to ~2.7s (single longest tool)

### 2. Caching Tool Results

For repeat requests within same session:

```typescript
const toolCache = new Map<string, { data: unknown; timestamp: number }>();
const CACHE_TTL = 60_000; // 1 minute
```

**Benefit**: Instant response for repeated customer queries

### 3. Progressive Streaming

Stream partial results as tools complete:

```typescript
// Show health immediately when calculate_health completes
// Show email draft when generate_email completes
// Don't wait for all tools to finish
```

**Benefit**: Perceived performance improvement, faster user feedback
