# Customer Success Copilot

Customer Success Copilot is an agentic assistant that helps Customer Success Managers and Technical Account Managers plan and execute day‚Äëto‚Äëday work ‚Äî preparing QBRs, mitigating churn risk, planning renewals, suggesting upsell/cross‚Äësell motions, and summarizing customer metrics.

Unlike a simple chat UI, the Copilot plans multi‚Äëstep workflows and calls backend tools (AWS Lambda) to fetch data and create assets, then returns a structured result you can act on (summary, health, actions, email draft, QBR outline).

This project is intentionally designed to demonstrate:
- **Agentic AI planning** (multi-step tool calls, not just prompting)
- **Secure serverless backend architecture** (stateless Lambdas + S3 + API Gateway)
- **Modern Next.js application design** (Next.js 16 beta, shadcn/ui, Zod, Zustand, Drizzle)
- **Production-aligned security patterns** (HMAC-signed tool calls, strict CORS, least-privilege IAM)
- **LLM flexibility** (Claude or OpenAI selectable at runtime)

## üåü What It Does

| Category | Features |
|-----------|----------|
| **AI/Agent** | Multi‚Äëstep planning with tool calling and partial‚Äësafe results |
| **Insights** | Usage summary, ticket analysis, health, churn signals, renewal risk |
| **Assets** | Follow‚Äëup email, renewal prep email, QBR outline |
| **Data** | S3 for customer metrics, Neon for auth/session/history |
| **Security** | HMAC signing, BetterAuth, CORS, Zod validation, PII controls |
| **Frontend** | shadcn/ui, TanStack table, Zustand, server actions |

## üîß Architecture Summary

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16 beta, Zod, Zustand, Drizzle, shadcn/ui | Thin client, no secrets |
| **Auth** | BetterAuth | Session-backed, Drizzle adapter |
| **Backend Tools** | AWS Lambda (Python 3.12) | One tool per micro-action |
| **Data** | S3 JSON + Neon | Lambdas stay stateless |
| **Async** | AWS SQS | For long-running work |
| **LLM** | Claude/OpenAI (user selectable) | via server actions |

## ‚úÖ Demo Goals (Acceptance)

A user can:
1) Choose a customer (e.g., `acme-001`) and a task template (QBR, Renewal Brief, Churn‚Äërisk Check)
2) Run the Copilot and see:
   - Planned steps and called tools (provenance + timings)
   - Structured result: summary, health, actions, email/QBR outline
3) Copy email/QBR content and next steps

---

## üöÄ Runbook (Dev Quickstart)

```sh
# Frontend
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# Backend (deploy tools or invoke locally)
cd backend
# see backend README for deploy instructions
```

Tip: You can verify the deployed backend without the frontend using the Node smoke test:

```sh
cd infra
make smoke-node API_URL=<api-url-with-stage> \
  HMAC_SECRET=<same-secret-as-SSM> CUSTOMER_ID=acme-001
```

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines (Demo)

To keep the Copilot consistent with the Barcai portfolio site, we adopt the same Tailwind v4 color tokens and rounded radii from the site‚Äôs `globals.css`:

- Primary: `#2f6ee6`
- Background/Foreground: light background `#ffffff`, dark foreground `#1e293b`
- Sidebar (dark): `#1e293b` with accent `#5a9bff`
- Radius: `~0.55rem` (medium rounding), subtle elevation shadows

Conventions:
- Dark mode supported via `.dark` class
- Use shadcn/ui + Radix primitives, lucide icons
- Keep result sections scannable: Summary, Health, Actions, Email/QBR, Used Tools

This is a demo app; we prioritize clarity and speed over exhaustive production hardening.
