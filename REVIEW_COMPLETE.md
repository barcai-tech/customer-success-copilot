## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Read** VISUAL_SUMMARY.md (5 min)
2. **Read** CODE_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md (10 min)
3. **Decide** which phases to implement

### Phase 1: High Value, Low Effort (2-3 hours) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

```
✅ Extract backend client utility (eliminates HMAC duplication)
✅ Move ClerkUserSchema to contracts (single source of truth)
✅ Remove unnecessary health API endpoint
```

**Why start here?** Highest ROI for time invested. Can be done in one afternoon.

### Phase 2: Medium Value, Medium Effort (3-4 hours)

```
• Add Error Boundary components (graceful error handling)
• Split validation.ts into modules (better organization)
• Create Store factory utility (consistency)
```

### Phase 3: Polish & Future-Proofing (3-4 hours)

```
• Convert useEvalStreaming to Server Action (consistency)
• Enhance streaming error handling (observability)
```
